## Speed of each car on 1/4 miles.

Using the `mtcars` dataset we want to understand the relationship between 1/4 miles time (qsec) and the displacement (disp) of the cars.

We plot weight (`qsec`) vs. displacement (`disp`), to understand this relationship. The color of each point on the graphic is related to the number of cylinders.

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~qsec, y = ~disp, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl),
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", qsec, '<br>MPG:', disp),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data")
```
